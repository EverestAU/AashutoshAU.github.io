# Introduction
I am Aashutosh Aman Mishra, a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Auburn University, graduating in December 2024. My expertise includes control systems, flight dynamics, and real-time simulation software, with a focus on rotorcraft and fixed-wing dynamics. Recognized with awards like the AIAA Orville & Wilbur Wright Graduate Award, I am committed to advancing aircraft safety and performance. I aspire to work as a Handling Qualities Engineer, contributing to the design and testing of aircraft that meet rigorous civil and military standards for handling qualities.

# Areas of Specialization
Aircraft design; Flight dynamic model for fixed-wing and rotorcraft; Aerodynamic model development;
Flight test data processing and calibration; Aircraft stability and control; Fly-by-wire
control law setup; 6-DOF non-linear piloted/auto flight simulation model development.
