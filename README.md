# Introduction
I am Aashutosh Aman Mishra, a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Auburn University, graduating in May 2025. 

My expertise includes aircraft design, aero-propulsive model development, flight dynamics, flight control system development, and real-time flight simulation modeling, with a focus on novel/unconventional advanced air mobility concepts. 

I aspire to work as a Flight Dynamics Engineer, contributing to the design and testing of aircraft that meet rigorous civil and military standards for handling qualities.
