# Introduction
I am Aashutosh Aman Mishra, a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Auburn University, graduating in December 2024. My expertise includes aircraft design, aero-propulsive model development, flight dynamics, flight control system development, and real-time flight simulation modeling, with a focus on novel/unconventional advanced air mobility concepts. 

I am honored to have received awards such as the AIAA Orville & Wilbur Wright Graduate Award (2024) and the AIAA Luis de Florez Graduate Award in Flight Simulation (2022), besides two best paper awards in aircraft design by AIAA. I aspire to work as a Flight Dynamics Engineer, contributing to the design and testing of aircraft that meet rigorous civil and military standards for handling qualities.

# Areas of Specialization
Aircraft design; Fixed-wing or rotorcraft flight dynamic modeling; Aerodynamic model development;
Flight test data processing and calibration; Aircraft stability and control; Fly-by-wire
control law setup; 6-DOF non-linear piloted/auto flight simulation model development.
