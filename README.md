# Introduction
I am Aashutosh Aman Mishra, a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Auburn University, graduating in May 2025. 
My expertise includes aircraft design, aero-propulsive model development, flight dynamics, flight control system development, and real-time flight simulation modeling, with a focus on novel/unconventional advanced air mobility concepts. 

I am honored to have received awards such as the AIAA Orville & Wilbur Wright Graduate Award (2024) and the AIAA Luis de Florez Graduate Award in Flight Simulation (2022), besides two best paper awards in aircraft design by AIAA. I aspire to work as a Flight Dynamics Engineer, contributing to the design and testing of aircraft that meet rigorous civil and military standards for handling qualities.
